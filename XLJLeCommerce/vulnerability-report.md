## Vulnerbility 1
### Encryption

Encryption on our site would look like when your password is not only displayed by dots when typing, but also is hashed in the background by the built in Identity API in .Net Core.

A user would not be able to identify this because they do not have access to the tables, however as developers we can see the table and it does not hold the password entered.
There is no code to fix this because luckily .Net Core took care of this for us. .Net Core created an API to handle identities of users for developers.
This is not an issue on .Net Core, as it already uses the stronges algorithm for password hashing, PBKDF2.

## Vulnerbility 2
### A1 SQL Injection
The SQL Injection vulnerbility in our site would look like our Management Services where we used Dependency injection to talk with the database. We didn't hard code any information. We used parameterized queries when we wrote our LINQ queries. For example in OrderedItemsManagementService, GetAllOrderedItems we utilized a passed in parameter for the ID than hard coding in an ID. 
![SQLInjectionExample](/assets/SQL injection.JPG)
A user would not be able to identify this because they cannot see our SQL calls. However a developer could see the code and how it was written.
There is not code required to fix it because it was already done correctly. This is not something that is built into >Net Core, it was encouragement for the process that we learned from class. 
This could be a problem for .Net Core because it doesn't check this for us in someway or prevent a developer from writing SQL queries without SQL Injection.


## Vulnerability 3
### Exposure
[vulnerability 3] on our site, we have a policy if the user registed more than a certain time(we are using one day just for testing purpose, normally one year), they become VIP and 

can view VIP products. Julie created an account on Feb 28th , and we tested this account on March 1st, since it is more than one day it should be allowed to access to VIP page, however,

it got denied and we did debuging found out the day is -28,which is very weird.

[this vulnerability] make our site unstable and user can be denied unappropriately.

Repair
 MinRegisterTimeRequirement.cs contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

[specific fixes here]

Above is the correct one, we use  " DateTime.Today.DayOfYear "  instead of  "DateTime.Today.Day".



## Vulnerability 4
### Exposure
[vulnerability 4] User can view our products without login , but when they trying to click cart, page went broken.Because there is no user logged in,and we can capture the userID(email), so the cart associated with user is null,that is why it was broken page.

[this vulnerability] cause our site damage, not function well.

Repair
CartController.cs contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

[specific fixes here]

we put if else statement around the query, that way if user doesn't log in it redirect to register page(assume does not have an account).
